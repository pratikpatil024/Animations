# Animations
Algorithm animation 


Language:
Python3


Modules Required:
networkx
matplotlib
time
sys


Input:
For BFS and DFS, the input will be given in a file named "input12.txt".
First line of "input12.txt" will contain the number of vertices/nodes (say n).
Then, next n lines will contain a n*n Adjancency Matrix.
And the last line (n+2nd line) will contain the start vertex.
NOTE: Vertices are numbered as 0, 1, 2, ......., n-2, n-1.
Ex:
5
0 1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0
0

For MST, the input will be given in a file named "input3.txt".
First line of "input3.txt" will contain the number of vertices/nodes (say n).
Then, next n lines will containa n*n Weighted Adjancency Matrix.
Ex:
5
0 2 6 0 0
2 0 4 8 3
6 4 0 7 0
0 8 7 0 1
0 3 0 1 0


Execution:
We can execute the file just by typing the given command in the terminal:
python3 ALGOpsp.py
(Make sure you are in the directory in which the ALGOpsp.py and both input file lies.)
